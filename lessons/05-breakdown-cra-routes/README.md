<h1 align="center">05 Break down CRA routes</h1>

> Setup the simplest Gatsby project

## System Requirements

- [git][git] v2 or greater
- [NodeJS][node] v10 or greater
- [npm][npm] v5.2.0 or greater

All of these must be available in your `PATH`. To verify things are set up properly, you can run this:

```shell
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

If you have trouble with any of these, learn more about the PATH environment
variable and how to fix it here for [windows][win-path] or
[mac/linux][mac-path].

## Setup

You may be able to work through the entire workshop in the browser. It requires
absolutely no setup whatsoever, though people do sometimes have trouble with it
working perfectly. However, if you would like to try it, go to
[this codesandbox (TODO)](todo)

If you'd rather be able to work through the workshop on your own computer, then
follow the following instructions.

## Installing dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

## Running the app

```sh
npm run develop
```

## Instruction

- Step 1
- Step 2
- more...

## Troubleshooting

<details>

<summary>"npm run develop" command not working</summary>

Please read through the error message and identify the step that is failing.
There should be an error message that will hopefully help guide you to the
solution. If it doesn't, please copy and past _all_ of the output into a new
issue on the project repository.
